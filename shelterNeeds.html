                    <p>One of our four big needs is adoption. What makes that one of the big four? Adoptions allow us to help
                        abandoned and unwanted cats and dogs find a loving home. With each adoption, a life is saved.</p>
                    <p> Also with each adoption the shelter, through the adoption fee, gets the much needed financial support
                        to continue its lifesaving efforts.

                    <p>They are your best source when looking for a pet. Pet Welfare has a great selection of cats and dogs
                        that are already spayed or neutered and up to date on all shots and you can see them all at our Pet
                        Finder pages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At Pet Welfare we screen all animals that come to our shelter. We ensure every animal is evaluated for temperament. The volunteers
                        give special attention to every "new" resident to the shelter to make them feel at home during their
                        adjustment period. During the interview process the adopter will ask many questions to ensure that
                        the pet you are thinking about adopting is the best match for you, your family, and situation. We
                        at Pet Welfare take each and every adoption very seriously.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Come in and meet our community of cats and dogs - we are sure if you are ready to adopt that we have the right pet for you
                        and your family.
