                    <p>One of our four big needs is adoption. What makes that one of the big four? Adoptions allow us to help
                        abandoned and unwanted cats and dogs find a loving home. With each adoption, a life is saved.</p>
                    <p> Also with each adoption the shelter, through the adoption fee, gets the much needed financial support
                        to continue its lifesaving efforts.

                    <h3>Funding Support</h3>
                    <p>Pet Welfare is a 501(c)(3) tax exempt, charitable, nonprofit organization. Cash gifts are very important
                        to Pet Welfare and are the easiest way to support our work. You can simply write a check or send
                        a money order. Donations are deductible to the full extent allowed by law.
                    </p>

                    <p>100% of all monetary donations go directly to maintain the shelter and to provide a safe and healthy
                        environment for the animals while they wait to be adopted into a forever home of their own!
                    </p>

                    <p>Pet Welfare will put your gift to work immediately on behalf of our animals.
                    </p>

                    <p>The donations are used for:
                    </p>

                    <p>Veterinary services (rabies shots, spay/neutering, medical procedures) Cat and dog food (includes special

                                <p>They are your best source when looking for a pet. Pet Welfare has a great selection of cats
                                    and dogs that are already spayed or neutered and up to date on all shots and you can
                                    see them all at our Pet Finder pages.

                                <p>
                                    At Pet Welfare we screen all animals that come to our shelter. We ensure every animal is evaluated for temperament. The volunteers
                                    give special attention to every "new" resident to the shelter to make them feel at home
                                    during their adjustment period. During the interview process the adopter will ask many
                                    questions to ensure that the pet you are thinking about adopting is the best match for
                                    you, your family, and situation. We at Pet Welfare take each and every adoption very
                                    seriously.
                                </p>

                                    Come in and meet our community of cats and dogs - we are sure if you are ready to adopt that we have the right pet for you
                                    and your family.

                                    "I hereby give, devise and bequeath to Pet Welfare, whose shelter is located on Range
                                    Road, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, 32542, the sum of $_________. These funds are to
                                    be used for the purpose of operating and maintaining the shelter as determined by the
                                    Pet Welfare Board of Directors." (It is suggested that you take this form to your attorney
                                    so that your specific request may be incorporated into your will.) Living Trust - You
                                    (or a beneficiary) receive the income from trust assets, and you name who will ultimately
                                    receive the remainder of the trust assets. Since the trust assets bypass probate, the
                                    terms are private. Insurance Policy - You may be able to take a charitable donation when
                                    you name Pet Welfare as beneficiary and assign us ownership of a life insurance policy.
                                    And since the proceeds are removed from your estate, you may benefit from reduced estate
                                    taxes. Stocks and Bonds - There are no capital gains taxes on the appreciation in value,
                                    no second tax on accumulated earnings by averting a dividend distribution, and you may
                                    benefit from an income tax deduction for the charitable contribution.</h3>

                                <h3>Memorials or Gifts - Many donations to Pet Welfare have been inspired by the memory of loved
                                    ones. Our pets are devoted companions who give us their friendship, love and acceptance.
                                    Often, the loss of an animal friend can be one of life's most difficult experiences.
                                    Making a donation to Pet Welfare is a personal way to honor the memory of a pet or person.
                                    This meaningful gesture will keep the spirit of a lost loved one alive, while helping
                                    all the animals.</h3>
