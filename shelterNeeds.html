                    <p>One of our four big needs is adoption. What makes that one of the big four? Adoptions allow us to help
                        abandoned and unwanted cats and dogs find a loving home. With each adoption, a life is saved.</p>
                    <p> Also with each adoption the shelter, through the adoption fee, gets the much needed financial support
                        to continue its lifesaving efforts.

                    <h3>Funding Support</h3>
                    <p>Pet Welfare is a 501(c)(3) tax exempt, charitable, nonprofit organization. Cash gifts are very important
                        to Pet Welfare and are the easiest way to support our work. You can simply write a check or send
                        a money order. Donations are deductible to the full extent allowed by law.
                    </p>

                    <p>100% of all monetary donations go directly to maintain the shelter and to provide a safe and healthy
                        environment for the animals while they wait to be adopted into a forever home of their own!
                    </p>

                    <p>Pet Welfare will put your gift to work immediately on behalf of our animals.
                    </p>

                    <p>The donations are used for:

                                        cats and dogs that are already spayed or neutered and up to date on all shots and
                                        you can see them all at our Pet Finder pages.

                                        At Pet Welfare we screen all animals that come to our shelter. We ensure every animal is evaluated for temperament. The volunteers
                                        give special attention to every "new" resident to the shelter to make them feel at
                                        home during their adjustment period. During the interview process the adopter will
                                        ask many questions to ensure that the pet you are thinking about adopting is the
                                        best match for you, your family, and situation. We at Pet Welfare take each and every
                                        adoption very seriously.

                                            in value, no second tax on accumulated earnings by averting a dividend distribution,
                                            and you may benefit from an income tax deduction for the charitable contribution.

                                            to honor the memory of a pet or person. This meaningful gesture will keep the
