                        <p> Pet Welfare is a 501 (c)(3) non-profit, no-kill animal shelter located on Eglin Air Force Base in Northwest Florida. The shelter places 100 - 150 surrendered and homeless cats and dogs every year. </p>

                        <p> Pet Welfare has been in operation since 1982 where we were once just giving the cats and dogs away
                            because there were so many and we were just happy to find a home for all the strays. Still to
                            this day Pet Welfare is a no-kill facility open to the public trying to aid the military when
                            they have to leave their pets behind.

                            Our purpose is to support the military member and military lifestyle by easing the hardship associated with abandoning or euthanizing a valued family member, the family pet. Permanent Change of Station to certain locations makes it unfeasible or impossible, in many cases, for military families to continue ownership and care of their family pet. We also support Department of Defense civilians, retired military members, and local civilians as necessary.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Although our priority is to the military member and their family, we provide shelter to many found animals and rescue many from local animal shelters that would euthanize pets at their shelter.

                            We receive no monetary support from the government, operating solely on donations, grants, adoption fees, fundraisers, and the Combined Federal Campaign contributions.

                            All Pet Welfare staff members are dedicated, hardworking volunteers devoting their time to make life better and safer for all our animals. We have no paid staff and all money collected goes toward the health and upkeep of all our shelter animals.
